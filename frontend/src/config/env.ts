/**
 * Single-source-of-truth for all runtime URLs consumed by the frontend.
 *
 * All three service URLs (relayer, Soroban RPC, Horizon) are read from
 * Vite env vars so they can be overridden per-environment without
 * touching compiled output.  Downstream modules MUST import from here
 * rather than hard-coding values or calling `import.meta.env` directly.
 *
 * Issue #556 — config drift fix: previously `NETWORK_CONFIG.rpcUrl` was
 * hard-coded in `contracts.ts`, `RELAYER_URL` lived inline in `api.ts`,
 * and `HORIZON_URL` had no canonical home.  This file is the single
 * composition-root for all three.
